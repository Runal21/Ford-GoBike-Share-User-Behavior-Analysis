# 🚲 GoBikeLens: Ford GoBike User Behavior Analysis  
Analyze urban bike-sharing data to uncover rider behavior, peak usage patterns, and operational insights—empowering data-driven decisions for better mobility services.

---

## 📌 Objective  
To enhance bike-sharing operations and customer experience by identifying key behavioral and operational factors such as:

- User type (Subscriber vs. Customer) behavior
- Peak usage times (by hour, day)
- Gender and trip duration trends
- Station-wise demand patterns
- Prediction of user types based on trip characteristics

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Subscribers dominate weekday usage, while casual customers ride more on weekends.
- Peak ride times are during commuting hours (8 AM and 5 PM).
- Male users take more trips on average, with similar trip durations across genders.
- Certain stations have high demand and require dynamic bike redistribution.
- A classification model can predict user type with notable accuracy using trip data.
